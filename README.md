# Image-Processing

This program is made using C#.NET WinForms. It can take an image and add filters to the image. Such as a multiplying the rgb values of the image, lightening, darken, sunset, greyscale and more. This was an individual project for high school in grade 12 computer science. It used a lot of concepts we had learnt prior such as nested loops, 2d arrays, file browsing and more.
