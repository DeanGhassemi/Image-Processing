# Image-Processing

This program is made using C#.NET WinForms. It can take an image and add filters to the image. Such as a multiplying the rgb values of the image, lightening, darken, sunset, greyscale and more. This was an individual project for high school in grade 12 computer science. It used a lot of concepts we had learnt prior such as nested loops, 2d arrays, file browsing and more. 

## Challenges

Every component of this program was a challenge. But the greatest challenge was pixelate, corners and blur. Each were so different and the thinking behind it did not make sense to me. To overcome it, I wrote a lot of possible solutions and approaches. Although I am unsure if they are the best ways, but making it work and being able to properly comment it became my first priority.
